# Insights and Key Findings

## 1. Inflation and Unemployment Trends
- **Volatility and Upward Trend**: Inflation and unemployment rates have shown significant volatility, especially over the last two decades.  
- **2016 Spike**: Inflation was particularly high in 2016 due to an economic recession.  
- **Rising Unemployment**: Since 2015, unemployment has steadily increased, likely due to slow job creation and economic instability.  

## 2. Sectoral Contributions to GDP
- **Dominance of Services**: The services sector remains the largest contributor to GDP, indicating Nigeria’s shift towards a service-oriented economy.  
- **Decline in Agriculture**: Agriculture, once a leading GDP contributor, has seen a steady decline in its share.  

## 3. Debt-to-GDP Ratio
- **Significant Increase**: Nigeria’s debt-to-GDP ratio has risen significantly since 2015, reaching nearly 38% by 2022.  
- **Fiscal Implications**: This trend suggests increased reliance on government borrowing, which may impact future fiscal policies.  

## 4. Unemployment Rate Analysis
### Interpretation:
- **Phase 1: Stability (1990-2004)**: Minimal variation, reflecting a relatively balanced labor market.  
- **Phase 2: Growth in Unemployment (2005-2020)**: Economic challenges, population growth, and structural job market changes contributed to a steady rise.  
- **Phase 3: Recovery (2021-2022)**: A decline in unemployment suggests that economic recovery efforts may have taken effect post-2020 disruptions.
