# Economic Analysis of Nigeria Using SQL and Data Visualization  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes Nigeria's economic data over the past few decades, focusing on key indicators such as inflation, unemployment, sector contributions to GDP, and government debt. The analysis leverages SQL for data extraction and manipulation, along with data visualization tools to provide insights into Nigeria’s economic performance from 1990 to 2022.

## Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to:  
- Examine trends in inflation and unemployment.  
- Analyze sectoral contributions to GDP.  
- Assess Nigeria’s government debt and its Debt-to-GDP ratio over time.  

---

## Key Analysis Areas  
- **Inflation and Unemployment Trends**: Analyzing how inflation and unemployment rates have evolved over time.  
- **Sectoral Contributions to GDP**: Investigating contributions from the Agriculture, Industry, and Services sectors.  
- **Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: Tracking government debt relative to GDP over time.

## Data Overview  
The data used in this project came from two primary sources:  

- **Dataset**: `Nigeria Economy - Data Prepared by Alaoh Sodiq.xlsx`  

### Data Columns:  
- **Year**: The year the data was collected.  
- **Inflation rate**: Annual inflation rate.  
- **Unemployment rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.  
- **Government debt**: Total government debt.  
- **Sector contributions**: Contributions of Agriculture, Industry, and Services to GDP.  
- **Nominal GDP**: GDP at current market prices.  
- **Real GDP**: GDP adjusted for inflation.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation  
Prior to analysis, the following data preparation steps were taken:  
1. **Standardized Column Names**: Ensured column names were consistent across datasets.  
2. **Handled Missing Data**: Filled or removed missing and redundant data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
The analysis focused on identifying trends and patterns in key economic indicators:  

### 1. Inflation & Unemployment Trends  
A line chart was used to visualize the relationship between inflation and unemployment rates over time.  
**Key Insights**:  
- Significant fluctuations in both inflation and unemployment rates.  
- Inflation was notably volatile, especially during the 2000s and 2010s.  
- Unemployment showed a gradual increase over the years.  

### 2. Sectoral Contribution to GDP  
A stacked bar chart or area chart was used to illustrate sector contributions (Agriculture, Industry, Services) over time.  
**Key Insights**:  
- The Services sector has shown consistent growth and is the largest contributor to GDP.  
- The Agriculture sector's contribution has declined, while the Industry sector’s share remained stable.  

### 3. Debt-to-GDP Ratio  
A line chart visualized the Debt-to-GDP ratio, showing government debt relative to GDP.  
**Key Insights**:  
- The ratio was above 70% in the early 1990s but dropped significantly in the mid-1990s.  
- From 2006 to 2015, the ratio rose steadily, reaching 23.7% by 2015.  
- Between 2016 and 2022, the ratio increased to 37.97%, reflecting rising debt levels.  

### 4. Unemployment Rate Trends  
Unemployment rates were visualized using a line chart.  
**Key Insights**:  
- Stability was observed in the 1990s and early 2000s.  
- A gradual rise began in 2005.  
- Significant spikes occurred between 2015 and 2020 due to economic challenges.  
- A slight recovery trend appeared by 2022, indicating potential improvements in economic conditions.
